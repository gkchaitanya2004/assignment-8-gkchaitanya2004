## 📌 Overview

The main goal of this assignment is to forecast **hourly bike rental counts** using the [UCI Bike Sharing Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bike+sharing+dataset), which consists of over **17,000 hourly records** influenced by factors such as **weather**, **season**, **temperature**, and **time of day**.

The objective is to **accurately predict the total number of rentals (`cnt`)** by applying and comparing multiple **ensemble regression techniques** to minimize **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**.

We explored and compared the following five models:

1. **Linear Regression**
2. **Decision Tree Regerssor**
3. **Bagging Regressor** 
4. **Gradient Boosting Regressor** 
5. **Stacking Regressor**
